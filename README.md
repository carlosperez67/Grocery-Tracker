# Groceries Tracker

### A smart way to keep track of costs and organize meals.

###### A quick synopsis of the application:
    



**What will this application be capable of?**:
- Keeping track of groceries expenses by tallying up individual item costs.
- Keep a record of your average daily, weekly and monthly groceries expenses
- Keep track of your average single meal cost.
- Record, and keep track of expiry dates and remind you when you have food that's about to expire.
- Be able to create a weekly meal plan and create automated shopping lists based on what you have and what you still need.

*Optional/Extra features I will add if time allows*:
- Keep track of where individual items are within your fridge/pantry to find them easily using a GUI.
  (This is useful if you share a fridge with roommates)

**Who will use it?**
- Individuals who cook alone and want to be better organized financially. 
- Able to save money and the environment by not letting food go to waste.
- With the weekly customizable meal plan and automated grocery list making, you can ensure you won't buy duplicates of things you already have at the store. 


**Why is this project of interest to me?**
- I'm living in a house with friends and I've realized that I quite often forget what I already have in my fridge. 
This has led to things going bad and me having to throw them out. Forgetting what I have also sometimes leads to me buying duplicates at the store because I'm not sure what I already have at home. I often forget to make a shopping list and having an automated way to create a shopping list would make life easier.
